## PLY-VIEWER

A viewer for the PLY 3D-object format.

[WIP] It is written using GTK, and it is horribly slow and my code is buggy as hell, but if you look closely you can see that it is a dragon below, right?. I just wanted to see if I could kind of make it work, and this is good enough for me :-)...
